-This project uses the WiFi network to connect between ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi<br>
-Both devices should install an RGB sensor and two LED's : Red and Green<br>
-The devices will send each other its RGB sensor's readings by UDP messages<br>
-Whichever is brighter, turns its Red LED ON, otherwise turns its Green LED on<br>
-If it can't receive a message from the other side, it flashes the Red LED to indicate an error condition<br>
